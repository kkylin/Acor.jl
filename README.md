# Acor.jl

This is a wrapper around [Jonathan
Goodman](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~goodman/)'s
[Acor](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~goodman/software/acor).
This particular version is based on [Dan
Foreman-Mackey](https://github.com/dfm)'s refactoring of
Jonathan's code, which he wrote for his [Python port of
Acor](https://github.com/dfm/acor).
